# Moms, Dads, and Dan Burnett's Wife

Authors: Kim Hamilton Duffy, Heather Vescent, and Daniel Pape

A challenge we observe in the self-sovereign identity (SSI) community is explaining the elements of SSI to users who may benefit from SSI technolofies who are not necessarily informed of the SSI tech stack. One challenge we observe is the canonical description of such a user.

The authors of this paper have found themselves confused by the use of the descriptor "mom" applied to such user. We've encountered individuals who identity as female yet nonetheless have active careers in Cryptography, Decentralized Identity, etc. Such individuals have an understanding of the SSI stack that exceeds ours (who are arguably considered experts in the field).

To address our confusion, a member of our community (who we'll refer to as "Dan Burnett") mentioned that his wife -- referred to as "Dan Burnett's wife" -- has consented to a characterization as an uninitiated user of SSI technologies. Heretofore, we propose to use "Dan Burnett's wife" as a canonical uninformed user who may benefit from SSI technologies.

Our goal is to produce a paper clarifying the importance of SSI technologies via a Verifiable Credential, validating the veracity of the SSI approach and recognizing the value of said technology, signed by "Dan Burnett's wife".
